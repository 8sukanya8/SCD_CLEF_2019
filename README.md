(1) preprocess_NLP_pkg-0.0.1.tar.gz may incur some path errors. You might either specify the full path as follows:
file:../../some/folder/path/SCD_CLEF_2019/personalLibrary/preprocess_NLP_pkg-0.0.1.tar.gz#egg=preprocess_NLP_pkg 
Or, you might also just install it directly using pip since the tar is available in the personalLibrary folder.
